*A note about version numbers:* I rushed to release the first version with version number 1.0.0.0. However, from version 2 which involved many major changes, I decided to assume my program a Beta software. So I decided to set this version scheme: first position denotes major changes which is currently 2, second position denotes being beta software which is *always* 0, third position denotes adding features and fourth position denotes bug fixes.
