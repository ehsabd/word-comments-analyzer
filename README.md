## Testimonials

> In our paper *'Skills to stay: social processes in agricultural skill acquisition in rural Karnataka'*, we used WordCommentAnalyzer as the computer assisted qualitative data analysis software for the qualitative data analysis. We used this software because it is an open source software which was quite intuitive and easy for coding qualitative data. For Global South researchers, this software is a boon as many institutions do not have the resources to have paid softwares for data coding. I carried out the coding of the transcripts by tagging sections of text/quotes with codes, which could later be aggregated and studied together to build the narrative. This resulted in a Q1 paper in a leading SCOPUS and Web of Science indexed journal of our field - *Third World Quarterly*, which we are very proud of. Thanks to the developer of this software, Dr. Ehsan Abdkhodaei for developing this user-friendly open source software for qualitative data analysis.

## Possible Future Development

- Port to a cross-platform code base by using Javascript (Angular or React) and Electron.

*A note about version numbers:* I rushed to release the first version with version number 1.0.0.0. However, from version 2 which involved many major changes, I decided to assume my program a Beta software. So I decided to set this version scheme: first position denotes major changes which is currently 2, second position denotes being beta software which is *always* 0, third position denotes adding features and fourth position denotes bug fixes.
